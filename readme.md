# Colas Python
This project is a Python implementation of a queue data structure. It can be used to emulate and visualize how a processor receives multiple processes from dispatchers.

## Description
The Colas Python project uses the tk and ttk packages for the GUI, and the threading, time, and os packages for the other code.

The project consists of the following files:

- main.py: The main file that starts the program.
- dispatcher.py: The file that implements the dispatcher class.
- procesador.py: The file that implements the processor class.
- proceso.py: The file that implements the process structure
- gui.py: The file that implements the GUI.
